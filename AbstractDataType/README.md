# ADT
A python program that creates, uses, and tests a simple Abstract Data Type that stores a sequence of values. Sequence ADT allow programmer to create instances of datatype SeqT. The SeqT type will be used to create a curve in Cartesian space and the values between the curveâ€™s data points will be determined using both interpolation and regression. The program will consist of two modules and a test driver program.
